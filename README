CS 537 project 4

This is a reimplementation of the functions of malloc, free and realloc. This program also implements the memcheck function. This is implementation provides some safety features of these functions.

Detailed description of these functions can be found on the webpage:
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bart/537/programs/program4.html

This program is written in C and can only be executed on Linux machines.

Compiling

This program uses GCC compiler and the pthread library. Since there is a makefile, just use "make" to compile the program.

Running

Here is an example of running:
./output

We ran our program on snares-5.cs.wisc.edu.
